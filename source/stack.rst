The Stack

What is the Stack?
******************

The Stack is a new Chanic Panic mechanic that enhances gameplay and adds
new strategies.

At its core, the Stack is a pile of face-down cards. Each players owns a 
personal Stack. Cards in the Stack are called Stack Cards, and they retain
this classification until they are discarded. Stack Cards have passive as
well as active effects. The value of a Stack Card is irrelevant as each
Stack Card is worth the same as any other.

Acquiring and Moving Stack Cards
********************************

- Each turn, a player may move 1 card from the hand to the Stack.
- When the *Ally* ability is used, the recipient of the card may choose to 
  add it to the Stack.
- Stack Cards may not be played, nor moved to the hand.

Stack Card Effects
******************

- At the start of you Point Phase: Gain 1 point for each card in your Stack.
- When you play a Utility Card: You may attach any number of cards from your
  Stack to it; Beginning at the end of the turn, that card's value is 
  increased by 2 for each Stack Card attached to it.
- When you hold fewer than 2 cards: You may discard 1 card from your Stack:
  Draw 2 cards.
- Each Stack Card you own gives you 1 Presence at the start of your turn.
- When satisfying an ability activation requirement that requires a constant
  number of discards, you may discard cards from your Stack as well as from 
  your hand when the following conditions are satisfied:

  - The discard is part of an activation requirement.
  - The discard applies to cards from your hand.
  - The number of discards required is constant.
  - No attributes of the discarded card are relevant in the ability. 

An effect of a Stack Card may not be activated the same turn it is added to 
the Stack.

Attaching
=========

- When a Stack card is attached to a Utility Card, it is moved from the Stack
  to the board and placed face-down horizontally underneath the card to which
  it is attached.
- A Stack Card may not be moved once attached.
- When the card to which a Stack Card is attached is destroyed or discarded,
  so is the Stack Card.
- When the card to which a Stack Card is returned to the hand, the Stack Card
  is returned to the Stack.

The Stack Cap
*************

5 Stack Cards; A player may not own more than 5 Stack Cards. This is the sum
of the number of cards in the Stack and the number of attached Stack Cards
on the board.
