Abilities are special actions and bonuses that players can use to their 
advantage. Using Special Abilities, those beyond the Base Abilities that
all players have, your Chanic Panic experience will be greatly expanded.

Playing with Abilities
**********************

Choosing Base Abilities
=======================

You are likely familiar with Base Abilities: *Trader*, *Ally*, *Panic*.
These abilities are available for all players to use. At the beginning of the
game, it should be decided which base abilities are going to be used.
*Trader* is strongly recommended for all games as it helps cycling and 
basic hand control. *Ally* is recommended for games with Teams. *Panic*
is left up to personal preference. Using it will lead to longer games.

Distributing Special Abilities
==============================

After deciding which base abilities to use, it must be decided how many
Special abilities each player will have. Unlike base abilities, special
are unique within a game. If new to special abilities, it may be a good idea
to have one special ability per player. In general 2 per player provides a 
good balance between excitement and manageability. Of course, you are free to
experiment with more.

To distribute special abilities, it is recommended to deal out one or two more
abilities to each player than decided. Then players can choose which abilities
to keep. For example, if there will be 2 special abilities per player, deal
3 abilities to each player. Each player then chooses 2 to keep and 1 to 
discard.

After all players have chosen their abilities, they are placed face-up on
the table. Players should go around reading their abilities so that everyone
knows how they work. If there is any confusion, consult the Ability
Reference.
