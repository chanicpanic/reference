Using this Document
*******************

This document describes in detail different abilities, their effects, usage,
and nuances. Great care has been taken to make the mechanics and descriptions
of abilities as precise as possible. This reference should be the final
word on any disputes in the function of an ability. This guide should be
used in tandem with the glossary, which provides precise definitions of
many terms used in ability descriptions. If you find anything ambiguous
or confusing, or to change, do not hesitate to contact me.

Classifying Abilities
*********************

Base vs. Special
================

There are two categories of Abilities, Base Abilities and Special Abilities.
All players in a game have Base Abilities while unique Special Abilities are
distributed at the beginning of the game.

Passive vs. Active
==================

There are two kinds of Abilities, Passive and Active. Passive abilities are
either always in effect, or activate when a certain condition is satisfied.
Active abilities need to be activated by a player and generally have
a temporary effect.

Using Abilities
***************

- Active abilities may be used during one's Point Phase or Club Phase, 
  unless otherwise specified.
- Any ability that involves Points may only activate during the Point Phase.
- Any ability that involves the Draw Phase does not activate the first turn.
- Abilities may be activated when the required event occurs.
- All events, costs, and conditions must be satisfied for an ability to
  activate.
- An ability may not be activated if one of its effects in unresolved.
- An ability may not be activated while another ability is unresolved at a
  semicolon.

Understanding Abilities
***********************

*Example*:


Syntax
======

The Colon (:)  
-------------

A colon is preceded by one of the following:

- An Event (when, during, at the start, before)
- A Usage Restriction (once per turn, once per game)
- A Cost (discard, pay, skip)

If the conditions preceding a colon are not satisfied, an ability's 
activation fails.

The Semicolon (;)
-----------------

The semicolon separates effect components and indicates that the effect is
not fully resolved.

The Period (.)
--------------

The period indicates the end of an ability's effect.
