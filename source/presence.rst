What is Presence?
*****************

Presence is a Chanic Panic mechanic designed to put a limit on the length of
games while adding an extra sense of urgency and strategy.

Presence is a cumulative score over the course of a game. It adds a secondary
win condition to the game. The first player to accumulate 200 Presence wins.

Accumulating Presence
*********************

All players start the game with 0 Presence.

At the start of each turn, the turn player gains 2 Presence for each card they
control on the board and 1 Presence for each Stack card they own.

Presence cannot be lost.
